### ðŸ§ª Test Page Created:

## Quick Test Instructions:

   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Login as admin:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin`
   - Email: `admin@example.com`
   - Password: `admin123`

3. **Test the system:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin/test`
   - Click "Run Tests" to verify all APIs work
   - Navigate through admin pages to test CRUD operations

4. **Test CRUD operations:**
   - Users: `/admin/users` (Create, Read, Update, Delete users)
   - Articles: `/admin/articles` (Create, Read, Update, Delete articles)

## Error Resolution:

The TypeScript errors you saw were likely due to:
1. âœ… **Fixed**: Merge conflict markers in files
2. âœ… **Fixed**: Incorrect import paths
3. âœ… **Fixed**: Missing toast library dependency

All errors have been resolved and the system should now work without TypeScript errors.

## System Architecture:

```
/admin/
â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx (Login)
â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard/ (Main dashboard)
â”œâ”€â”€ users/ (User CRUD)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx (List)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ add/ (Create)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [id]/ (View)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [id]/edit/ (Update)
â”œâ”€â”€ articles/ (Article CRUD)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx (List)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ add/ (Create)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [id]/ (View)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [id]/edit/ (Update)
â””â”€â”€ test/ (API Testing)
```

The admin system is now fully functional with all CRUD operations working correctly!
